== Overview ==
Create a log parser that can:
Read an access log file
Resolve Country and State from IP address (IE MaxMind GeoLite2 Free)
Translate useragent to device type (Mobile, Desktop, Tablet) and Browser (Safari, Chrome, etc)
Combine new Geo & Device fields with existing fields on access log file and output/export a CSV

The goal of this test is to showcase your ability to leverage existing libraries without writing an exhaustive amount of code. Reach out to us if you need additional direction. 

Below is a sample access log you can use if you don't have one.

Must be run from the cli
Provide instructions on how to build and run
Must be written in either PHP, Python or NodeJS

== Bonus == 
Do this all with Docker
Unit Test
